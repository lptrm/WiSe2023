/*
 * For the AES algorithm, some computations are done by Galois Fields (GF).
 * With the following problems, we practice some basic computations.
 * Compute the multiplication and addition table for the prime field GF(7). A mul-
 * tiplication table is a square (here: 7 Ã— 7) table which has as its rows and columns all
 * field elements. Its entries are the products of the field element at the corresponding
 * row and column. Note that the table is symmetric along the diagonal. The addition
 * table is completely analogous but contains the sums of field elements as entries
